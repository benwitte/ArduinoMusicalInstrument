# ArduinoMusicalInstrument

This repo holds the code for a musical instrument made with Arduino. The device plays the four most commonly used guitar chords, at varying speeds and in 9 octaves. It relies on an infrared sensor to determine the chord, a light sensor to determine the octave, and a potentiometer to determine the speed of the notes. The light and infrared sensors are dynamically calibrated, so that they should function under the majority of lighting conditions (though there may be limitations in extremely dark environments).
