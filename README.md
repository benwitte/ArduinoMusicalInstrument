# ArduinoMusicalInstrument

This repo holds the code for a musical instrument made with Arduino. The device plays the four most commonly used guitar chords, at varying speeds and in 9 octaves. It relies on an infrared sensor to determine the chord, a light sensor to determine the octave, and a potentiometer to determine the speed of the notes.
